OpenDB-libs
This repository is an library plus header prebuilt version of OpenDB, the OpenROAD physical database.
Soon it will be obsolete when OpenDB is opensourced. The plan is to open source OpenDB under a BSD-3 license.
This prebuilt version is temporarily licensed as GPL as indicated in the license file.

To start, run the script set_ade_envi after modifying it to correctly point to the directory holding the clone of OpenDB.
then type ade to enter the OpenDB tcl shell.
