MDSC is the core subsystem of MDS that performs data set serving
to mds clients, using sockets.

 mdsc.1: has full information on the operation of MDSC
  tmdsc: is the mdsc test program
mkstats: collects statistics from the test logs (in the logs directory)
         and produces an xgraph plot 

make server will run the server demo

make client will run the client tests (preferable on a different machine)

The test server runs as:
    ./tmdsc server -port 1234 -size 100m -log server.log

It will listen to port 1234 and copy a 1000 Megabyte object to every client
Log file will be "server.log"

TO run the test clients:

    ./tmdsc client -server localhost -port 1234 -n 10 -p 2 -checksum no

This will retrieve 10 objects (the -n option) with a parallelism
of 2 (the -p option specifies how many copies can happen concurrently)
