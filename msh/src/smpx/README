SMPX: simple point tool multiplexer

SMPX allows multiple clients to reach a limited pool of servers, 
in order to submit commands.

SMPX allows multiple clients to use a limited pool of servers,
in order to submit commands. SMPX simply manages the round robin
use of the server; the clients still need to connect to the server,
and to setup/restore any state.

The following example illustrates the operation of smpx:

Each server needs to register with smpx:

 # -- create an instance of smpx client
 LSMPXClient smpx -address port@host
 # -- register a server named 'pt' (listening to: myport@myhost)
 smpx Register pt myport@myhost

Each client may request a server:

 # -- create an instance of smpx client
 LSMPXClient smpx -address port@host

 # -- reserve a pt server and wait until you get it
 smpx Reserve pt
 smpx Wait STATUS
 # -- STATUS array contains interesting information

 # -- at this point the client may connect to $STATUS(address)
 to be serviced by the server just reserved

 ...
when done, the client should release the server:

 smpx Release pt $STATUS(address)


When the point tool exits, smpx UnRegister should be called

SMPX runs as a server, and expect connections from its clients
and registrations from its servers
