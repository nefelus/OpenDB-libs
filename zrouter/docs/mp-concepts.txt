ADE (the Athena Distributed Environment) employs distributed multiprocessing,
to achieve high performance extraction (TurboRC), several times faster than the
uniprocessor case.

In case of TurboRC, ADE works by sending N remote jobs to LSF (where
N is set by the user, or by the site configuration), each eventually running
a copy of the Cadence QX uniprocessor extractor to be accellerated.

In order for ADE to achieve maximum performance, and as such, minimum
execution time, a number of favorable factors need to be present:

1. Since TurboRC uses the LSF selected queue to run its parellel distributed
jobs, that queue needs to allow N CONCURRENT jobs to run. In many installations
LSF limits the number of outstanding user jobs to just a few.
ADE will function with less than N concurrent jobs, but of course at lower
performance.

2. When running on the remote node, ADE will run the third party extractor QX.
It means that for the duration of the parallel distributed jobs,
that TurboRC will require N QX licenses to be available, in order
to achieve maximum performance. Of course, TurboRC will function 
with less than N available licenses, albeit, at lower performance.
