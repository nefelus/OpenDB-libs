ZROUTE development notes

tclcompile
	this pseudo goal will compile all tcl scripts into bytecode form
	which will make it impossible to view or disassembly
	It only affects the TCL subdirectories (msh,mtlib,zroute,zui)

license
	zroute and zui now require a license to run (see -L or ADS_LICENSE)
	for normal athenads, zroute and zui will pickup the license file
	from src/utils/ads.lic which has no restrictions.
