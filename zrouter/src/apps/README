This directory contains the end user applications, which are invoked
using the safe interpeter method.

Please do not install any other code here.


THEORY OF OPERATION

An ADE application is really a symlink to the ade program
If ade is invoked as such (i.e. app), it will look for a command called: 
ade_app. If one exists, it will be called with a safe interpeter
as paramater. This command is supposed to add aliases to the interpeter,
to provide for the user visible entry points.

If interactive, ade will connect to that interpeter, so the end user
can only enter commands of that safe interpeter.

See turborc.tcl as an example of an ade application
