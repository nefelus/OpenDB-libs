DPT 

DPT is a picture taking facility, which renders shapes to
slices. Later it can map slices to an image, based on colorization
attributes.


All crawler calls should support an additional optional argument:
-channel channel
	to send the result to an open channel, instead of returning the value

-grid
	to generate a picture of the given format

the grid should use DPT

The crawler needs to support a few new configuration arguments
and pass them to dpt class

crawler configure -grid grid-size
specify the grid sizes

crawler config -colors colormap-list
should set the colormap to colorize the picture


Typical USE:

DCR dcr

# -- configure the grid size
dcr configure -grid "1024 1024" -slices 32

# -- clear the picture
dcr clear

# -- send all objects to dpt
dcr chip_get .... -bbox "0 0 100 100" -grid

# -- specify which layers to show and which colors to use
dcr configure -colors "0/signal/wire ffffaa 1/inst/bbox 00aa00"

# -- convert slices to an image
dcr paint

# -- send out the image (as a result value, ppm binary)
dcr image -image= image
dcr image -encoding base64 -image= image

# package require Tk
# label .f -image [image create photo -data $image]
# pack .f

dcr image -format ppm -encoding base64
dcr image -format ppm -encoding base64 -channel file12
