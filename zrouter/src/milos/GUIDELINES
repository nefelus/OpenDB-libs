Current module guidelines for Milos:

1) each command that has options must specify the appropriate information
for the PARMS, P_ALIAS and P_HELP arrays, as needed

2) each command with options must call parse_args before using args

3) parse_args by itself is sufficient - it creates an array called "OPT" in
the caller's namespace

4) you can use "check_arg" and "get_arg" to retrieve information about the
OPT array. Or, you can use ::info exists - just info exists will not work
because info had to be redefined to close a security hole.

5) the "required" parameter can have various values - see vob.tcl. If
parse_args passes, all requirements have been met, so you can assume
required parameters were specified.
