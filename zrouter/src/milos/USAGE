New Milos Structure
===================


1) configure is gone. Each command requires parameters to be passed with
-parameter value. Each command (if it takes parameters), has a list of
required and optional parameters (with defaults, if appropriate).

2) pdb cmd ? will give a quick summary, pdb cmd ? -long will give a long
summary of the options for that command

3) pdb help cmd and pdb help cmd -long are the same thing as the above.

4) pdb gives a quick summary of just the commands
