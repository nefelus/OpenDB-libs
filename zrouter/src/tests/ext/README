extraction tests

te.tcl   extract the e block, flat
 output: e_names.spef    normal spef file
         e.spef          spef file using ids instead of names,
                         to be used in te_read.tcl
         e.ctot          a total cap report, to use as
                         a reference in other tests
 compare: none


te_read.tcl   read and write flat spef for e block
 input:   e.spef          from te.tcl 
 output:  e2.spef
 compare: diff e.spef e2.spef
          shows only small differences in
          the D_NET lines, caused by roundoff


tex.tcl   break the e block into 24 tiles,
          run all the tiles locally,
          assemble the results
 input:   e.ctot           from te.tcl
 output:  all.spef         final spef
 compare: The test compares total R and C to e.ctot
        

texm_def.tcl  break the e block into 3 tiles,
              in remote nodes, write tile defs
 > do runall
 > do post
 output:  scratch/T*def T*tcl

texm_spef.sh  run zroute on the tile defs
 input:   scratch/T*def T*tcl
 output:  scratch/T*spef

texm_read.tcl  On remote nodes, read tiles spefs
               Assemble
 > do runall
 > do post
 input:   scratch/T*spef
 compare: The test compares total R and C to e.ctot
