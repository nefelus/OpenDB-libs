ext_h

Multiprocessing extraction using zroute as a
third-party extractor, on block e, with halo nets.

flat.tcl
  Runs flat extraction

texm.tcl
  Complete multiprocessing run
  Note: in texm.tcl, there is a call to zroute
  as a third-party tool,
  exec zroute < $b.tcl > $b.log
  If the zroute being tested is not in the PATH
  from .profile, then you may need to use a full path here,
  for example change to
  exec /home/wfs/work/latest/zrouter/dist/i386-linux/bin/zroute < $b.tcl > $b.log

def_nomsh.tcl
spef.sh
read_nomsh.tcl
  These 3 scripts mimic texm.tcl without
using multiprocessing.  Used for debugging.
