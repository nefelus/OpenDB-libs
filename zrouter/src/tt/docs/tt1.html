<h1>TT - Testing Tool Documentation</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

 <h3>Testing Tool (tt): designed to run regression or other ade tests
with a flexible command-syntax and a concise summary of results. It
includes support for platform-dependent and ade-dependent options.</h3>


<h2>Concepts</h2>

tt has several distinct modes of operation: 
<ul>
    <li>test execution: clean, run, and diff
    <li>clean/run/diff: perform individual stages of a test
    <li>dry-run mode: show what would be done - similar to make -n
    <li>show mode: show available tests
    <li>create new test(s)
</ul>
        

tt introduces two concepts of test organization:
<ul>
    <li>packages: physical directories under the main "tests" directory<br>
        e.g.: db, tmg, sta, etc
    <li>groups: virtual collections of tests, joined by a common attribute
    <li>PACKAGES take precedence over GROUPS
</ul>

tt can be invoked in several ways:
<ul>
    <li>run it directly from the tt subdirectory
    <li>make &lt;tt command&gt; from the src directory
    <li>run_test shortcut script
</ul>
