<h2>TT - Testing Tool Documentation</h2>

<h3>CVS comments</h3>

<p>
It is currently up to the user to ensure all test-related files are added to
CVS. This may include (but is not limited to): test.exe test.attr Makefile
test.log.GOLD test.tcl and any other data or command files related to the
test.<br><br>

This will require at least:<br>
make cleantest<br>
cvs add .<br>
cvs add *<br>
cvs commit<br><br>
or some other series of cvs commands to accomplish the same, once the test
has been created. Note: the make cleantest is to get rid of intermediate log
files and such, which should NOT be checked into CVS - test.log.GOLD is the
log file that will be checked into CVS


<h3>upcvs, upgold</h3>
Commands <b>upgold</b> and <b>upcvs</b>, while currently defined have not
been tested extensively. <br><br>

The current action of <b>upcvs</b> is to call "cvs update" in the test
directories.<br>

The current action of <b>upgold</b> is:<br>
cp test.log test.log.GOLD
cvs commit test.log.GOLD

Please be sure this is what you intend when using these commands.
