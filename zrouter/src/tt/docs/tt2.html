<h2>TT - Testing Tool Documentation</h2>


<h3>Requirements:</h3>

<h3> A copy of ade must be found in the current PATH.</h3>

Non-execution operations can still be performed (show, dry-run) without a
copy of ade. 

tt will run against the ade in the current path - easy to switch testing
directories!


<h3>Packages vs. Groups</h3>

Packages
<ul>
    <li> a specific physical subdirectory
    <li> contains one or more tests in the tt-defined format. 
    <li> tt-defined format: any directory containing test.exe and optionally test.attr. 
    <li> For example, in the following directory structure: 
         tests/sta/test1<br>
         tests/sta/test2<br>
         tests/sta/test3<br>
         tests/sta/newtests/test1<br> 
         the package is sta. The tests within package sta are test1,
         test2, test3 and newtests/test1.
    <li> package names CANNOT include underscores
</ul>

<h3>Goal: Every subdirectory within "src" that contains ade code
will have a corresponding "package" subdirectory within the tests
directory tree.</h3>

Groups

<ul>
    <li> a virtual construct 
    <li> relates tests from various packages
    <li> group tests have a common function
    <li> each test can belong to any number of groups (via test.attr)
    <li> e.g., sta/test1 and db/test2 belong to "sanity" group<br>
         sta/test3 and db/test3 belong to "extended" group.
    <li> a new group can be created at any time by anyone
</ul>
