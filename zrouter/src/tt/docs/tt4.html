<h2>TT - Testing Tool Documentation</h2>


<h3>Using Groups</h3>

<ul>
<li>test_build,sanity   - execute ALL tests within groups build and sanity
<li>test_build,sta      - execute ALL tests within group build and package sta

<li>test_build,sta_1-3  - execute tests 1-3 of sta, ALL test of group build

</ul>

Note: test_show_build,sta_1-3 will show tests in build 3 times, but will only
execute them ONCE.<br><br>


<b>Using the _all range</b><br><br>

The _all suffix is assumed in cases where a range or list is not
specified.<br><br>

test_sta,build and test_sta,build_all are equivalent.<br>
test_show and test_show_all are equivalent.<br><br>

The only case where _all is required is: test_all which runs EVERY test in the
system.<br><br>


<h3>Using individual commands</h3>

<p>Instead of re-executing a test (which may take a long time), if only some of
the stages of execution need to be performed, the individual commands can be
used.</p>

<ul>
<li>test_diff_sta       - perform the "diff" portion for all sta tests
<li>test_clean_build    - perform the "clean" portion for all build tests
<li>test_run_db_1-2     - perform the "run" portion for db tests 1 and 2
</ul>
