<h2>TT - Testing Tool Documentation</h2>

<h3>Logging of output</h3>

<p>All output from tt is sent both to stdout, AND to a log file. By default,
this is tt.log in the directory where tt resides. The -l option to tt
specifies a different log file location/name.</p>


<h3>tt command-line options</h3>

tt has several command-line options which affect the behavior of tt. 
<ul>
<li>-h              Show this help message and then exit
<li>-l &lt;file&gt;       copy output to &lt;file&gt; instead of tt.log
<li>-n              Show Only mode - show what would be done without doing it
<li>-t &lt;dir&gt;        Redefine the "top" level directory where tests are located
<li>-u &lt;path&gt;       Use this ade instead of the one in PATH
<li>-v              Verbose mode - show more information
<li>-z &lt;args&gt;       Specify ade startup arguments
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The most useful for starting out is the -n "dry-run" mode, which is just
like make -n.<br>
    It shows each test that would be processed, without actually doing
    anything.

<li>The -l option is useful for saving the output log to a different location.

<li>The -v option will show more details than the default.

<li>Example for -z: test_sta_1-3 -z "-P 12"<br>
    will invoke as: ade -P 12 &lt;other...&gt;
</ul>

<p>
You can use the <b>~/.ttrc</b> file to store "frequently used" options. If
you call tt with: tt -t dir, and ~/.ttrc contains "-t otherdir", then tt
will act as if you had called it with: tt -t otherdir -t dir. That is, .ttrc
arguments are parsed FIRST, and THEN command-line arguments.
