<h3>Creating a new test</h3>

<ul>
<li>test_new            - create a new test
<li>test_new_sta        - create a new test within the sta package
<li>test_new_sta_3      - create 3 new tests within the sta package
</ul>

The following information is required for a new test and will be asked for:
<ul>
<li>package (if not provided in original command)
<li>test group(s) (existing test groups shown, can be selected by number)
<li>ade commands (defaults to: source test.tcl)
<li>platform (defaults to: current platform)
<li>runtime (no default)
<li>ade compiled-in options (defaults to: none)
<li>ade startup options (defaults to: none)
</ul>

Runtime can be omitted just by entering a blank.

At minimum, the user must still create/provide two more files:<br>
<ul>
<li>test.tcl - ade commands that produce the test output
<li>test.log.GOLD - default "GOLD" file, expected output from running the
test<br>
can be initially created by: make test.log; mv test.log test.log.GOLD
</ul>

<p>
A test requires test.exe (automatically created) which calls (by default)
test.tcl. test.tcl should be a series of tcl ade commands which performs
the required test. Usually, the success or failure of the test will then be
determined by doing a diff of the output vs. test.log.GOLD.
