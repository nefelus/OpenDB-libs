<h3>Step-by-Step Procedure for creating a new (non-custom) test</h3>

Assumptions:
<ul>
    <li>existing test is contained in file sta_test.tcl
    <li>existing test is part of sta package
    <li>existing test requires data files db1.lef db1.lib
    <li>output of test can be diffed and compared with known good file log.GOLD
</ul>

Steps to convert test to tt format:
<ul>
    <li>call tt with test_new_sta (or test_new and specify sta as the package)<br>
        (also see next section run_test)
    <ul>
        <li>select groups to which test should belong
        <li>enter "source sta_test.tcl" instead of default "source test.tcl"
        <li>enter description, runtime (if known)
        <li>enter sta for required compiled-in options (or "none" if none)
        <li>enter blank for required ade startup options, unless required
        <li>enter "y" to create the test(s)
    </ul>
    <li>cd to test directory
    <li>following files should exist: test.exe test.attr Makefile
    <li>copy sta_test.tcl to current directory
    <li>copy db1.lef and db1.lib to current directory
    <li>copy log.GOLD to current directory and rename it to test.log.GOLD
    <li>run "make test.diff" to see if test is working
    <li>run "run_test show_sta -v" to see if your new test shows up in the system
</ul>
