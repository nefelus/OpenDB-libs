<h3>run_test shortcut</h3>

<ul>
<li> run_test: a shortcut 
<li> automatically installed into "DIST" directory along with ade
<li> requires ade DIST directory to be in PATH
<li> runs tests from the test directory that belongs to THAT DIST directory
<li> execute tests from ANY test package/group from any location
<li> expected to be most common way to use tt
</ul> 

<h3>All commands remain the same as before, except that test_ is added
automatically, so should be omitted.</h3>

<p>For instance, if package sta is being worked on, after recompilation
and installation:<br><br>
run_test sta<br><br>
will run all sta tests without leaving the current directory. </p>
<br>
run_test has two special features: 
<ul>
<li> puts the tt.log file into the current directory rather than the tt
directory
<li> the command "run_test template" creates a template test in the
current directory.<br>
Creates (and overwrites): Makefile, test.exe, test.attr and tt.log. <br>
</ul>
<br><br>

At minimum, the user must still create/provide two more files:<br>
test.log.GOLD<br>
test.tcl<br>
<br>
