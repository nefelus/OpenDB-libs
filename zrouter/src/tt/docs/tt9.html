<h3>Customizing tests</h3>

Default targets run by tt:
<ul>
<li>for clean: cleantest
<li>for run: test.log
<li>for diff: cleandiff test.diff
<li>for exec: all 3 above
</ul>

The default rules for creating test.diff are as follows:

<pre>
%.diff: %.log
    diff -b -B $< $*.log.GOLD > $*.tempdiff
    mv $*.tempdiff $*.diff

%.log: %.exe
    ./$< > $*.templog
    mv $*.templog $*.log

</pre>
The sequence of commands is then:<br>
run test.exe and redirect the output to test.templog<br>
if successful, rename test.templog to test.log<br><br>

run diff -b -B test.log test.log.GOLD &gt; test.tempdiff<br>
if successful, rename test.tempdiff to test.diff<br><br>

The intermediate steps (templog, tempdiff) are needed to avoid skipping a
test execution if the first execution fails. <br><br>

The default Makefile is just one line:<br>
<pre>
include ../../Makefile.rules
</pre>

A sample customized Makefile:<br>

<pre>
include ../../Makefile.rules

DIFFLOGS += test.slack

test.diff: test.slack
    diff test.slack test.GOLD > test.diff

test.slack: test.log
    grep slack test.log > test.slack
</pre>

In this example, test.diff depends on an intermediate step: grepping for the
word "slack" inside test.log. The output of the grep is stored in
test.slack, and then test.slack and test.GOLD are diffed to produce
test.diff. The DIFFLOGS variable adds the file test.slack to indicate that
it is a part of the "DIFF" process, and should be cleaned up whenever "make
cleandiff" is executed.<br><br>
