SYNOPSIS
	mproxy -- multi architecture script proxy

DESCRIPTION
	mproxy allows programs written for different architecture to
	run using a common path. In addition, mproxy allows the environment
	to be correctly set up for an architecture.

	The following directory layout is assumed:

	$TOP/bin
		mproxy
		testit -> mproxy
	$TOP/i386-linux
		bin
			testit

	The use simply puts $TOP/bin in his path. When testit is executed on
	a linux 386 system (see mproxy for details), mproxy will be executed
	instead, due to the symlink of $TOP/bin/testit to $TOP/bin/mproxy

	when running on a linux 386 system,
	mproxy will then attempt to exec $TOP/i386-linux/bin/testit

CUSTOMIZATION
	mproxy should be modified to accommodate other architectures
	than sun7 or linux/386 (32 bit)

BUGS
	no way to force a different compatible architecture like
	when running 32-bit applications on a 64 bit AMD.
