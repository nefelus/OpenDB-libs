ZROUTE LICENSING 

Until we use flexlm, zroute expects a valid athenads license, or it will
not work.

upon startup and before anything else, zroute looks for a license file in:

	1. -L file option
	2. ADS_LICENSE enviroment variable
	3. ../../../src/utils/ads.lic (from the place zroute script run)

-L has priority over ADS_LICENSE, etc.

the license file can be constructed by modifying ads.lic first,
and then running it through the mklicense program:

mklicense < foo.lic ADS2005

where ADS2005 is the salt for the digital encryption, we use so far

utils/ads.lic is a license upto 2010 and should not be distributed to
any customer

(see zroute/zr.tcl for the exact value)

Please check the utils/*.lic for examples
