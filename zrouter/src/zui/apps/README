ADE: application specific visualization

Every application may request a specific visualization scheme
from the gui, using the following process:

* on ADE there is a UIAdapter subclass. Its purpose is to adapt the
backend to the gui needs. The gui will be talking to the adapter only,
when it needs to visualize an ADE application

* the adapter will indicate the class of visualization it needs,
and the UI will instantiate that. All such visualization methods
need to be UIViz subclasses.
