ZC stands for the ZCANVAS, an abstraction used to draw CAD objects
and other information.

ZC defines the protocol of the zcanvas

There are two implementations:

TkZC : based on TkCanvas
QtZC : based on Qt

Debug [pattern]
dprint label format-string [args]

 Can be used to debug messages issued by dprint and labeled as anything matching
 the "pattern". For example:

 Debug test1.* will debug all calls to test.* like:

 dprint test1.a "xxx"
 dprint test1.b "yyy"

 but not:

 dprint test3.b "zzz"
 
 dprint generates a <<debug>> event on zc, so it will not print automatically
